binary command structure:  [header, user_data, tail]


header = 
[     byte 1     |    byte 2      |      byte 3      |       byte 4      ]
[  msg size LSB  |  msg size  MSB |   flags 8bit     |    cmdID 8bit     ]

data size does include header.
cmdID=0x00 is special echo command and should not be used.


flags: 
[     bit 8    |        bit 7    |        bit 6           |       bit 5      ]
[    reserved  |      reserved   |      reserved          |      reserved    ]

[     bit 4    |       bit 3     |        bit 2           |      bit 1       ]
[   reserved   | INTEGRITY_STAMP |  SUPPRESS_REPLY_HEADER |  EXTANDED_HEADER ]
